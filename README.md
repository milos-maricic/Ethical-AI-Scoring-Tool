# Ethical AI Scoring Tool

This tool evaluates the ethical risks of deploying AI systems. It provides an overall ethical score by assessing data bias in protected attributes (e.g., gender, race) and evaluating model interpretability. It combines these metrics to offer a weighted ethical score for AI systems.

## Features
- **Data Bias Check**: Assesses the distribution of protected attributes like gender and race to identify potential bias.
- **Model Explainability**: Evaluates feature importance to assess model transparency and interpretability.
- **Overall Ethical Score**: Combines bias and explainability scores to produce a final ethical rating for the AI system.

## How It Works
1. **Input Data**: Load a dataset with protected attributes (e.g., gender, race) and an AI model (optional).
2. **Bias and Explainability Analysis**: The tool calculates scores for bias and explainability.
3. **Final Ethical Score**: An overall ethical score is generated based on the bias and explainability assessments.

## Example Usage
```python
# Load dataset and define protected attributes
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'gender': np.random.choice(['male', 'female'], size=100),
    'race': np.random.choice(['group_1', 'group_2', 'group_3'], size=100),
    'age': np.random.randint(18, 70, size=100),
    'income': np.random.randint(20000, 100000, size=100)
})

# Simulated feature importance for a model
feature_importances = np.random.rand(4)
model = type('Model', (object,), {'feature_importances_': feature_importances})()

# Generate ethical score
protected_columns = ['gender', 'race']
ethical_report = generate_ethical_score(data, protected_columns, model, ['gender', 'race', 'age', 'income'])
```
